    quote: "Man is a mystery. It needs to be unravelled, and if you spend your whole life unravelling it, don't say that you've wasted time. I am studying that mystery because I want to be a human being.",
    source: "Letter to Mikhail Dostoevsky, 1839",
    annotation: "He was eighteen years old when he wrote this. The reader should sit with that. An eighteen-year-old who had already decided that the unravelling of a single human soul was sufficient purpose for a life. He never changed his mind.",
  },
  {
    quote: "Beauty will save the world.",
    source: "The Idiot, 1869",
    annotation: "Prince Myshkin says this, and Ippolit demands to know what it means, and Myshkin cannot explain. Neither could Dostoevsky. He believed it absolutely and could not prove it, which is precisely the condition he thought faith required. The statement is not a program. It is a wager.",
  },
  {
    quote: "Above all, don't lie to yourself. The man who lies to himself and listens to his own lie comes to a point where he cannot distinguish the truth within him, or around him, and so loses all respect for himself and for others. And having no respect, he ceases to love.",
    source: "The Brothers Karamazov, 1880",
    annotation: "Father Zosima is speaking to Fyodor Karamazov, the buffoon, the liar, the man who has turned his self-deception into performance art. He speaks gently. The passage is almost unbearably kind. Dostoevsky understood that the most dangerous lies are the ones we find most comfortable.",
  },
  {
    quote: "Pain and suffering are always inevitable for a large intelligence and a deep heart. The really great men must, I think, have great sadness on earth.",
    source: "Crime and Punishment, 1866",
    annotation: "Raskolnikov says this, and he is wrong — or rather, he is using a truth as an excuse. Dostoevsky knew how to make his characters speak genuine wisdom for corrupt purposes. The sentence is real. The application is the problem.",
  },
  {
    quote: "If God does not exist, everything is permitted.",
    source: "The Brothers Karamazov, 1880 (attributed to Ivan Karamazov)",
    annotation: "Ivan does not quite say this in so many words. The phrase is a condensation — the compression of a hundred pages of argument into one terrible axiom. Dostoevsky spent his life trying to disprove it. He succeeded, in his novels, and failed, in his nightmares.",
  },
  {
    quote: "I love mankind, he said, but I find to my amazement that the more I love mankind as a whole, the less I love man in particular.",
    source: "The Brothers Karamazov, 1880",
    annotation: "Rakitin says this of the elder Ferapont. It is one of the most efficient diagnoses of a certain kind of idealism ever written. To love humanity in the abstract is easy and costs nothing. To love the specific, difficult, smelling, demanding person in front of you — that is the test Dostoevsky kept administering.",
  },
  {
    quote: "To love is to suffer and there can be no love otherwise.",
    source: "Notes from Underground, 1864",
    annotation: "The Underground Man says this bitterly, having just destroyed his only chance at genuine connection. He means it as a complaint. Dostoevsky means it as a fact of nature. The difference between them is everything.",
  },
  {
    quote: "The second half of a man's life is made up of nothing but the habits he has acquired during the first half.",
    source: "The Diary of a Writer, 1876",
    annotation: "He wrote this while thinking about the peasantry, about reform, about the Russian national character. It applies, as he knew it would, to everyone. The habits he meant were not mannerisms. He meant the grooves of thought, the pathways of response, the routes the soul travels automatically in the dark.",
  },
  {
    quote: "There is only one means of salvation, then take yourself and make yourself responsible for all men's sins, as soon as you make yourself responsible in sincerity for everything and for everyone, you will see at once that this is really so, and that you are in fact to blame for everyone and for all things.",
    source: "The Brothers Karamazov, 1880",
    annotation: "Father Zosima's teaching, which sounds like madness and is, in fact, the load-bearing beam of the entire novel. Dostoevsky believed this. He had been to Siberia. He had stood before a firing squad. He had met the men who would shoot him and felt, somehow, responsible.",
  },
  {
    quote: "The mystery of human existence lies not in just staying alive, but in finding something to live for.",
    source: "The Brothers Karamazov, 1880",
    annotation: "The Grand Inquisitor is making his case against Christ — the argument that freedom is too heavy a burden, that men would rather be fed and controlled than free and responsible. Christ says nothing in response. He kisses the old man on the lips. This is Dostoevsky's answer to the question of meaning.",
  },
  {
    quote: "Take care of the pennies and the pounds will take care of themselves, is equally true of drops of blood.",
    source: "Crime and Punishment, 1866",
    annotation: "Porfiry is speaking, circling Raskolnikov the way a planet circles a dying star. He never accuses directly. He suggests, implies, withdraws. Dostoevsky understood that guilt makes its own confession, if you give it time and a witness.",
  },
  {
    quote: "It takes something more than intelligence to act intelligently.",
    source: "Crime and Punishment, 1866",
    annotation: "The problem of Raskolnikov in one sentence. He is the most intelligent person in every room he enters and he cannot act well in any of them. Dostoevsky had no patience for the idea that reason was sufficient. He had reasons for this.",
  },
  {
    quote: "I want to tell you something, my friend: the man who can suffer greatly can also greatly love.",
    source: "The Idiot, 1869",
    annotation: "Nastasya Filippovna says this, and she is speaking about herself, and she is entirely right about herself, and her love will destroy her. Dostoevsky did not write cautionary tales. He wrote tragedies in which the protagonists' finest qualities are also their instruments of ruin.",
  },
  {
    quote: "What is hell? I maintain that it is the suffering of being unable to love.",
    source: "The Brothers Karamazov, 1880",
    annotation: "Father Zosima defines hell not as punishment but as condition — a state of permanent incapacity. The damned are not tortured; they are simply unable to do the one thing that would save them. Dostoevsky thought about hell a great deal. He had been there.",
  },
  {
    quote: "The formula 'two and two make five' is not without its attractions.",
    source: "Notes from Underground, 1864",
    annotation: "The Underground Man is rejecting the Crystal Palace — the rational utopia Chernyshevsky had proposed, in which all human behavior follows from optimal self-interest. He finds it suffocating. He prefers to be wrong, freely, to being right at the cost of his will. Dostoevsky agreed with him more than he intended.",
  },
  {
    quote: "We sometimes encounter people, even perfect strangers, who begin to interest us at first sight, somehow suddenly, all at once, before a word has been spoken.",
    source: "Crime and Punishment, 1866",
    annotation: "The novel's first page, and already he is in your confidence. He writes about strangers the way a doctor writes about symptoms — with absolute attention, without sentimentality, in the full knowledge that the interest is the diagnosis.",
  },
  {
    quote: "I did not bow down to you, I bowed down to all the suffering of humanity.",
    source: "Crime and Punishment, 1866",
    annotation: "Raskolnikov to Sonya, prostrate on the street before her. He is trying to explain himself, which is always when he is most dishonest. But even his rationalizations contain the truth he cannot face: that the suffering he has caused is real, and Sonya embodies it, and he owes her something he does not know how to give.",
  },
  {
    quote: "Shower upon him every earthly blessing, drown him in a sea of happiness, so that nothing but bubbles of bliss can be seen on the surface; give him economic prosperity, such that he should have nothing else to do but sleep, eat cakes and busy himself with the continuation of his species, and even then out of sheer ingratitude, sheer spite, man would play you such a trick that the Crystal Palace would come tumbling down.",
    source: "Notes from Underground, 1864",
    annotation: "Written in 1864, in response to a utopian novel. What Dostoevsky understood — what the rationalists could not — is that human beings are not problems to be solved. They are mysteries who will undo any solution simply because they can. He found this maddening and beautiful in equal measure.",
  },
  {
    quote: "If you were to destroy in mankind the belief in immortality, not only love but every living force maintaining the life of the world would at once be dried up. Moreover, nothing then would be immoral; everything would be lawful, even cannibalism.",
    source: "The Brothers Karamazov, 1880",
    annotation: "Ivan's argument, again — the terrible logic that haunted Dostoevsky from the Petrashevsky Circle to his deathbed. He could not refute it philosophically. He could only write Alyosha. For Dostoevsky, the refutation of an argument was always a person, never a premise.",
  },
  {
    quote: "To live without hope is to cease to live.",
    source: "The Diary of a Writer, 1877",
    annotation: "He wrote this the year before his last great surge of composition — the two years in which he completed The Brothers Karamazov. He was fifty-six. He had been poor most of his life, epileptic, imprisoned, exiled. He wrote this and meant it as a statement of biological fact.",
  },
  {
    quote: "Perhaps the most terrible thing is that I do not know whether I am wicked or kind, whether I am a monster or a martyr.",
    source: "A Raw Youth, 1875",
    annotation: "Arkady Dolgoruky speaks this — the illegitimate son, the young man forming himself in public, the character most like Dostoevsky at twenty. The uncertainty is not false modesty. He genuinely could not tell. Dostoevsky thought this confusion was honest, and therefore the beginning of wisdom.",
  },
  {
    quote: "There was nothing, it seemed to me, more exasperating than to be rich, to live in luxury, and at the same time, in a corner of your heart, to feel that you are morally inferior to one of those poor people who, with nothing, knows how to remain worthy.",
    source: "The Diary of a Writer, 1876",
    annotation: "He was writing about the Russian aristocracy, whom he resented and, in complicated ways, envied. But he was also writing about himself — a man who had been poor enough to know what it cost, and who never quite escaped the sense that suffering had given him something the comfortable could not buy.",
  },
  {
    quote: "Grown-up people do not know that a child can give exceedingly good advice even in the most difficult case.",
    source: "The Brothers Karamazov, 1880",
    annotation: "Father Zosima is thinking of Ilyusha, of the dying boy and the children gathered around him, of the possibility that moral knowledge is not accumulated but revealed — that children have access to it before life educates it away. Dostoevsky watched children closely. He had buried two of his own.",
  },
  {
    quote: "The soul is healed by being with children.",
    source: "The Idiot, 1869",
    annotation: "Prince Myshkin, who was himself childlike in the purest sense — without calculation, without self-protection, genuinely attentive — believed this from experience. He had spent time in Switzerland with children. He had been happy there. The novel is partly about what happens when such a person enters society. Society wins.",
  },
  {
    quote: "Power is given only to those who dare to lower themselves and pick it up. Only one thing matters, one thing; to be able to dare!",
    source: "Crime and Punishment, 1866",
    annotation: "Raskolnikov's theory, delivered with the confidence of a young man who has read too much philosophy and suffered too little consequence. It is not entirely wrong. Dostoevsky never made his villains entirely wrong. That was his method and his mercy.",
  },
  {
    quote: "I am a sick man. I am a spiteful man. I am an unattractive man. I believe my liver is diseased.",
    source: "Notes from Underground, 1864 — opening lines",
    annotation: "The most famous opening in Russian literature, and among the most famous in any literature. He begins with illness, spite, ugliness, and bad faith. By the second paragraph he admits he may not be sick at all. The unreliable narrator — the man who cannot stop performing even for himself — was born here.",
  },
  {
    quote: "If they drive God from the earth, we shall shelter him underground. One cannot live without God — at least not for long.",
    source: "The Brothers Karamazov, 1880",
    annotation: "Old Karamazov's servant Smerdyakov says nothing so noble. This is Father Zosima, near his death, and it is Dostoevsky speaking most directly. He had been where God was absent — in the labor camp, in the exile, in the gambling dens of Baden-Baden — and had found it uninhabitable.",
  },
  {
    quote: "It is not as a child that I believe and confess Christ. My hosanna is born of a furnace of doubt.",
    source: "Notebooks, 1880–81",
    annotation: "He wrote this in the final year of his life, preparing notes for the second volume of The Brothers Karamazov that he would not live to write. The furnace of doubt is the whole of his work — every argument Ivan makes, every cruelty Raskolnikov commits, every gamble he placed and lost. The hosanna is still there. That is the achievement.",
  },
  {
    quote: "There are three things that human beings fear most of all: scandal, secrets, and debts.",
    source: "The Brothers Karamazov, 1880",
    annotation: "He knew about all three at close range. The debts especially — the gambling debts that drove him to write The Gambler in twenty-six days, to fulfill a contract, while simultaneously writing Crime and Punishment. He hired a stenographer. He married her. This, too, is a kind of love story.",
  },
  {
    quote: "The degree of civilization in a society can be judged by entering its prisons.",
    source: "The House of the Dead, 1862",
    annotation: "He had entered its prisons. Four years in Omsk, with common criminals — murderers, thieves, men who had done things he was not sure he could describe. He described them. He found in them something the free and comfortable could not perceive: evidence that the human soul survives almost anything.",
  },
  {
    quote: "We are all responsible to all for all, apart from our own sins.",
    source: "The Brothers Karamazov, 1880",
    annotation: "Father Zosima's central teaching, returned to again and again, elaborated and simplified and returned to again. Dostoevsky wrote it into the novel the way a craftsman works a joint — testing it from every angle, applying pressure, until it would hold. Whether it holds is the question the novel puts to the reader.",
