        I did not write to be read comfortably. I wrote to be felt — in the chest, in the sleepless
        hours, in the place where you are not entirely honest with yourself. But since you have asked
        for an orientation, I will attempt one. I will try not to make it too dignified.

      <div class="prose">
        <p class="drop-cap-para">
          The sentences are long. I know this. My editor knew it too, and said so, at some length,
          in sentences that were themselves not short. But the length is not an accident or a failure
          of discipline — it is the shape of a mind that cannot stop qualifying, cannot stop seeing
          the next objection, cannot land on a conclusion without immediately undermining it.
          You will learn to read this. The sentence that runs for a paragraph is not meandering; it
          is building. Follow it to the end.
        </p>
        <p>
          The names will be a difficulty. Russians have three: a given name, a patronymic, and a
          surname. They use all of them, interchangeably, depending on who is speaking and how formal
          the moment is. Alexei Fyodorovich Karamazov is also Alyosha, also Alexei, also — to his
          enemies — Karamazov. Keep a small list in the margins. You will not need it for long.
        </p>
        <p>
          The intensity will be a difficulty of a different kind. My characters do not have moderate
          feelings. They love absolutely, hate absolutely, doubt absolutely, believe absolutely — and
          sometimes do all of these simultaneously, which is the part that is hardest to render on
          the page and perhaps most true. If you are accustomed to fiction in which people are
          coherent, the incoherence here will seem like bad writing. It is not. People are incoherent.
          I noticed this in prison, and I never forgot it.

    <!-- What he was arguing -->
    <section class="guide-section">
      <h2>What I Was Actually Arguing</h2>
      <div class="prose">
        <p>
          There is one question behind everything I wrote: <em>Can a man be free and good at the same time?</em>
          The nineteenth century had two answers. The first was the liberal answer: educate him,
          improve his conditions, and he will naturally tend toward the good. The second was the
          religious answer: surrender to God and the good will follow. I did not trust either answer,
          and spent forty years trying to find out why.
        </p>
        <p>
          The underground man is my experiment with the first. He is educated, he is intelligent, he
          understands perfectly well what is in his interest — and he refuses it. Not because he is
          stupid. Because he is a man. The will to defy, to choose against one's own interest simply
          to prove that one <em>can</em> choose — this is not a defect. It is evidence of something
          irreducible in the human creature that no Crystal Palace can accommodate.
        </p>
        <p>
          Raskolnikov is my experiment with the second. He commits murder on principle — a logical
          principle, coherently reasoned — and is destroyed not by punishment but by the part of him
          that knew, before the reasoning began, that it was wrong. That knowing has no name. It is
          prior to the reasoning. I have spent a great deal of time trying to understand what it is.
        </p>
        <p>
          And then there is Alyosha, who is my answer, insofar as I have one. He does not argue.
          He loves. It is not a sentimental love — it is a love that sees clearly and accepts what
          it sees. This is harder than anything the Grand Inquisitor proposes.

      <h2>Who I Made</h2>
      <div class="prose">
        <p>
          Nietzsche read me. He said I was the only psychologist from whom he had learned anything.
          He was not easy to please. He took from me the underground man — the will that defies the
          rational calculus — and developed it into something I would not have recognized and might
          not have approved. But the seed was mine.
        </p>
        <p>
          Kafka found in my work a way to render the experience of guilt without the possibility of
          absolution — something I thought I had put there only for Russia, but which turned out to
          be portable. His <em>Trial</em> is my Grand Inquisitor made modern and stripped of faith.
          I am not sure this is an improvement, but I understand why he did it.
        </p>
        <p>
          The French existentialists — Camus, Sartre, Beauvoir — built their philosophy from my
          question: if there is no God, what grounds the obligation to be good? They gave different
          answers than I did. Camus in particular could not accept my answer, which required Christ,
          and said so directly. I respect this. A man who refuses an answer he cannot believe is more
          honest than one who accepts it without examination.
        </p>
        <p>
          Freud cited me in his essay on the uncanny. I confess I find it amusing to have contributed
          to psychoanalysis from four centuries away, without a couch. The double — the self that
          watches the self, and hates what it sees — was something I wrote before the vocabulary for
          it existed. Freud gave it a vocabulary. I remain unconvinced the vocabulary explains it.
        </p>
        <p>
          And then there are the ordinary readers — the ones who find me at nineteen, at some
          difficult hour, and come away changed in a way they cannot quite account for. These are
          the ones I wrote for. I find I am more moved by them than by the philosophers.

        Three doors into the work, in order of difficulty. All of them are real.

          <h3><em>Notes from Underground</em></h3>
          <p>
            Start here. It is short — a hundred and thirty pages — and it will tell you, immediately
            and without apology, whether you can hear this voice. The underground man is
            insufferable, brilliant, self-destructive, and honest in the specific way that people
            who are very dishonest with themselves sometimes manage to be honest about that
            dishonesty. If you finish it hating him, you have understood it. If you finish it
            recognizing him, you have understood it better.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="reading-entry">
          <h3><em>Crime and Punishment</em></h3>
          <p>
            The second door. Raskolnikov kills a woman to prove a theory, and the novel is about
            what happens inside him afterward. It is not a crime novel in any ordinary sense —
            the murder happens early, the detective work is almost beside the point. What the novel
            is about is the mind refusing to live with itself. Read it slowly. The Petersburg
            atmosphere — the heat, the yellow rooms, the canals — is doing as much work as the
            psychology. They are the same thing.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="reading-entry">
          <h3><em>The Brothers Karamazov</em></h3>
          <p>
            The third door, and the largest. I wrote it knowing it would be my last novel.
            Everything I had been arguing for forty years is in it: freedom and authority, faith and
            doubt, the love that saves and the love that destroys, the father who deserved to die and
            the son who cannot live with having wished it. The Grand Inquisitor chapter is in the
            middle of Book Five. You can read it alone. But it means more when you have earned it.
