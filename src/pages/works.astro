    title: "Poor Folk",
    date: "1846",
    type: "Novel",
    note: "My first. A clerk and a seamstress, exchanging letters across a courtyard. I was twenty-four. Belinsky wept. I confess I found this gratifying.",
    url: "https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2302"
  },
  {
    title: "The Double",
    date: "1846",
    type: "Novella",
    note: "A civil servant encounters his exact double. The double is better at being him than he is. The story was not well received. I maintain it is among my finest work. These two positions are not contradictory.",
    url: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Double_(Dostoevsky_novel)"
  },
  {
    title: "Notes from the House of the Dead",
    date: "1862",
    type: "Novel",
    note: "Four years in Omsk, recounted through a fictional narrator. The fiction was thin. The men were real. I have never written anything more true, and I have never found anything true more difficult to write.",
    url: "https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37536"
  },
  {
    title: "Notes from Underground",
    date: "1864",
    type: "Novella",
    note: "The underground man speaks for forty pages without being interrupted. He is spiteful, self-contradictory, and correct about almost everything that matters. I did not agree with him. I understood him completely.",
    url: "https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/600"
  },
  {
    title: "Crime and Punishment",
    date: "1866",
    type: "Novel",
    note: "A psychological account of a murder. Or rather: an account of what happens in the mind before, during, and after. The murder itself takes almost no space. People find this puzzling. I do not.",
    url: "https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2554"
  },
  {
    title: "The Gambler",
    date: "1866",
    type: "Novel",
    note: "Written in twenty-six days to fulfill a contract while simultaneously writing Crime and Punishment. I hired a stenographer named Anna Grigoryevna to help me. I later married her. The novel is about a man who cannot stop gambling. I was, at the time, such a man.",
    url: "https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2197"
  },
  {
    title: "The Idiot",
    date: "1869",
    type: "Novel",
    note: "I wanted to portray a truly beautiful man. I discovered, in the writing, that such a man would be destroyed by society. Prince Myshkin is entirely good and entirely helpless. Perhaps these are the same quality.",
    url: "https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2638"
  },
  {
    title: "Demons",
    date: "1872",
    type: "Novel",
    note: "Based on the Nechaev affair — a student revolutionary murdered by his own circle, in the name of the cause. I was writing about nihilism. I did not anticipate that the century to come would require me to write about it at greater length.",
    url: "https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8117"
  },
  {
    title: "A Raw Youth",
    date: "1875",
    type: "Novel",
    note: "Arkady Dolgoruky: an illegitimate son, seeking his father, forming himself in public. The least read of my major novels. I believe this is the reader's error, not mine.",
    url: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Raw_Youth"
  },
  {
    title: "The Brothers Karamazov",
    date: "1880",
    type: "Novel",
    note: "Three brothers. A murdered father. The question of whether God exists and, if not, whether anything remains. I spent three years on it and died four months after it was completed. I intend this as neither coincidence nor symbol. It was simply the book I had to write, and then I wrote it.",

        There are also shorter pieces — stories, sketches, the journalism of thirty years. The <em>Diary of a Writer</em> alone runs to twelve hundred pages. I mention this not to overwhelm you but to prepare you. The work is large. The questions it addresses are larger. I recommend beginning wherever you find yourself already standing.
